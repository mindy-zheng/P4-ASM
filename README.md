# CS4280 Programming Translation Project -- P4:
- Cloned all source files from P3 - Static Semantics (incl. Parser & Scanner) 
- Local storage 

## Testing: 
- There are 3 testing files that are calling static semantic errors, thus not creating assembly language appropriately. 
## How to Run: 
1. Run make
2. Run: 
	- ./comp P4_1.f23 
		- This will generate a file with the assembly language. In this case, the file would be: P4_1.asm
